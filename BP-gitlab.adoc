== Introduction

Gitlab in his link:https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#gitlab-com[free online plan] offers some nice features :

* 2,000 CI pipeline minutes per group per month on our shared runners
* Unlimited private projects and collaborators
** Built-in CI/CD
** Cycle Analytics
** Issue Boards
** Time tracking
** Preview your changes with Review Apps
** Publish static websites for free with GitLab Pages
** Git LFS 2.0 support

== Server configuration

WARNING: TODO

== Project creation

* Create a project in web interface.
** check *Create README.md* or else *master* branch is not created
* Import git project in Eclipse
* Change git config, adding :

[source, ini]
  [user]
    name = yourname
    email = youraccount@yourprovider.com

=== Configure rebase without merge commit

* In the web interface, go to *Project* -> *Settings* -> *General* -> *Merge request*, and configure as follow :
** [x] Fast-forward merge
** [x] Only allow merge requests to be merged if the pipeline succeeds 
** [ ] Only allow merge requests to be merged if all discussions are resolved

=== Protect master branch

Gitlab workflow is not as straightforward as Gerrit's (see below). In Eclipse, it's too easy to push to master instead of our current Merge Request's branch.

Here is how to protect it :

* In Gitlab interface, navigate to your project -> *Settings* -> *Repository* -> expend *Protected Branches* and configure :
** Branch = *master*
** Allowed to merge = *Maintainers*
** Allowed to push = *No one*

=== Configure Eclipse

Clone the repository as you would do for any Git repository, see link:BP-Eclipse.html[Eclipse Best Practices] for details.

=== Merge Requests workflow

We assume that we will be the only one to push on that branch, so we do not check-out the branch, and just push there. This helps do fewer interactions in Eclipse.

.Initialize the change
* In Gitlab
** Go to *Issues* -> *New issue*
** Set information and create
** Click *Create merge request*
* In Eclipse
** right click on your repo -> *Pull*
*** The branch should appear under *Branches* -> *Remote Tracking*
** In *Remotes* -> *origin*, right click on the second address and choose *Configure Push...*
** Click *Add...*
*** Remote branch = <type the number to get the full branch>
*** [x] Force update
*** The specification should be something like

  +HEAD:refs/heads/4-minor-asciidoc-changes

*** Press *OK* then *Save*

Eclipse should now be ready to handle smoothly Gitlab workflow. You can check your repository git config which should be like :

[source, ini]
.git/config
  [core]
    repositoryformatversion = 0
    filemode = false
    logallrefupdates = true
  [remote "origin"]
    url = https://gitlab.com/bcouetil/academy.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    push = +HEAD:refs/heads/4-minor-asciidoc-changes
  [branch "master"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
    rebase = true
  [user]
    name = myname
    email = myaccount@myprovider.com

.dev iterations
* The first time
** Update your files...
** Go to *Git Staging* view
** Stage your files
** Hit *Commit and Push...* and *Close*
* On each new iteration do the same and
** [x] toggle ON *Amend*
** change the text if needed

WARNING: Don't toggle on *Add Change-Id*, this changes the behavior of *Commit and Push...* towards Gerrit style.

TIP: More details and screenshots in link:BP-eclipse.html[Eclipse Best Practices]

Now a pipeline should be launched in Gitlab interface.

.Merge in Gitlab
* Browse the Merge Request in Gitlab
* [x] Remove source branch
* Pull in Eclipse to be up to date
