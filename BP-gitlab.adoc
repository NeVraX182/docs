== Server configuration

WARNING: TODO

== Project creation

* Create a project in web interface.
** check *Create README.md* or else *master* branch is not created
* Import 

=== Merge Requests workflow

We assume that we will be the only one to push on that branch, so we do not check-out the branch, and just push there. This helps do fewer interactions in Eclipse.

.Initialize the change
* Go to *Issues* -> *New issue*
* Set information and create
* Click *Create merge request*
* In Eclipse, right click on your repo -> *Pull*
** The branch should appear under *Branches* -> *Remote Tracking*
* Update the files...
* Commit
* Right click on local/master -> Push Branch...
** Toggle
*** [ ] Configure Pull
*** [ ] Force
**  Next -> Finish

.On each new dev iteration
** Commit with amend, ignore the warning
** Right click on local/master -> Push Branch...
** Toggle
*** [ ] Configure Pull
*** [x] Force
** Next -> Finish

.Merge in Gitlab
* Browse the Merge Request in Gitlab
* [x] Remove source branch
* Remove the Remote branch in your git repo -> Branches -> Remote Tracking
* Right click on your repo -> *Pull*
** If you get an error, you have obviously configure Pull for the dead branch, so use *Pull...* instead and select *master* branch
