== History

The initial development of Gerrit started when a code review system for *Android* was requested. Because many Google developers were involved in the development of Android, the new system needed to have a feature set similar to the Google internal review system *Mondrian*. For this purpose, *Rietveld* was started. Because the development of Rietveld was not fast enough, Rietveld was forked and developed separately, then as *Gerrit*.

The name originates from that of the Dutch architect Gerrit Rietveld.

== User documentation

Official user documentation is link:https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/intro-user.html[here].

== Installation

TIP: With the openfrontier/gerrit image, you can start a ready-to-use dockerized server with persistant data in a local folder, SMTP and replication configuration. More information/examples link:https://github.com/openfrontier/docker-gerrit[here].

.Using docker
[source,bash]
----
$ docker run -d --name gerrit-of -p 8080:8080 -p 29418:29418 \

== Configuration

TIP: You can switch from new UI (PolyGerrit) to old UI with the link at the bottom of any page, and you can switch back to PolyGerrit by adding `?polygerrit=1` in the URL.

=== Initialization

NOTE: Updated with new UI

* Connect to Gerrit homepage
** First person to connect is the administrator
** Without LDAP, other users are added at first connection

So, as the administrator :

* Skip the plugin configuration
* Click on the image in the top right corner -> btn:[Settings], and set
** Full name
** Changes per page = 100 rows
** Date/time format
** [x] Set new changes to "work in progress"
*** Click btn:[Save changes]
** Ignore Whitespace = All
*** Click btn:[Save changes]
** New email address = your@mail.com
*** reload page
*** select your mail in list
*** delete email@example.com
*** Click btn:[Save changes]
** Click btn:[Generate New Password]
*** save it for later

==== Permissions

NOTE: In further sections, actions are for old UI

===== Jenkins user push

* Click on btn:[People] -> btn:[List Groups] -> btn:[Non-interactive Users]
* Add Jenkins' technical account in the list

===== Deleting tags

* Click on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List] -> btn:[All-projects] -> section btn:[Access] -> btn:[Edit]
* Under `Reference: refs/tags/*`
** Click on btn:[Add Permission...] and select btn:[Push]
** Select group btn:[Administrator] and click btn:[Force Push]
** Save Changes

Now you can delete tags from your projects, for ex :

[source, bash]
  git push --force --delete origin cg-wm-1.17.6
  
[[gitweb-access]]
===== Allow (gitweb) access for everyone

* Click on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List] -> btn:[All-projects] -> section btn:[Access] -> btn:[Edit]
* Under `Reference: refs/meta/config`
** Under `Read`
*** Click on btn:[Add Group]
*** Enter `Registered Users`
*** Click btn:[Add]
*** Save Changes

==== Verified status

* Click on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List] -> btn:[All-Projects] -> section btn:[General] -> btn:[Edit Config]
* Add this

 [label "Verified"]
    function = MaxWithBlock
    value = -1 Fails
    value =  0 No score
    value = +1 Verified

* Click on btn:[Save], then btn:[Close]
* Click on btn:[Publish Edit], then btn:[Publish], btn:[Code-Review+2], btn:[Submit]
* Click on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List] -> btn:[All-Projects] -> btn:[Access] -> btn:[Edit]
* Under btn:[Reference:	refs/heads/*]
** Click on btn:[Add Permission...] and select btn:[Label Verified]
** Select group btn:[Administrator]
** Select group btn:[Non-Interactive Users]
** Save Changes

==== Fast Forward

By default, when projet submissions are not fast forward, final submitting a change will create a merge commit. The history is potentially doubled.

* Click on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List] -> btn:[All-Projects] -> btn:[General]
* Under btn:[Submit Type], select btn:[Rebase if Necessary]

.Life without code review
image::devrant-git-blame.jpg[{half-width}]

=== User preferences

Click on  btn:[YourName] -> btn:[Settings] -> btn:[Diff Preferences] and set *columns* = `120`
(you will probably have to paste it due to a GUI bug)

=== Project creation

==== Old UI

Create your GIT project by clicking on btn:[Projects] -> btn:[Create New Project]

* Project Name = `your-project-name`
* Rights Inherit From = `All-Projects`
* Check that it has inherited correctly "Rebase if necessary", else change and save

==== PolyGerrit

Create your GIT project by clicking on btn:[Browse] -> btn:[Repositories] -> btn:[Create New]

* Repository Name = `your-project-name`
* Rights Inherit From = `All-Projects`
* Owner = `the-code-owner`
* Click btn:[Create]
* Check that it has inherited correctly "Rebase if necessary", else change and click btn:[SAVE CHANGES]

[[project-url]]
==== Project git address/URL

To get the repo address of your project under Gerrit : 

* Navigate to btn:[Projects] -> btn:[List]
* in front of btn:[your-project], click on (gitweb)
* Take the .git text next to *URL*

Example : https://my-url.com/gerrit/my-project.git

NOTE: If you don't have access to Gitweb interface ("Not Found"), ask your admin to do <<gitweb-access>>.

image::geek-and-poke-dont-update.jpg[{tier-width}]

== Jenkins configuration

=== Plugin installation

* Go to btn:[Jenkins] -> btn:[Administration Jenkins] -> btn:[Gestion des plugins]
* Install Gerrit Trigger

=== Plugin Configuration

* Create the console-master job if not already existing
** Create a new freestyle job.
** Name it console-master

== Code review golden rules (using Gerrit)

image::gerrit-process.png[{full-width}]

.These are rules to be followed for a smooth overall development process :
. The team has to know that you are taking responsability of the current development task.
. If not sure of what to achieve, confirm with task responsible
. Target a complete realization in delays estimated by team leader. Alert on time shortage.
. Update documentation along with code whenever it's needed.
. Do not group functionnalities in commit, to avoid long run reviews.
.. It is possible to handle multiple review in parallel.
. Commit text has to be explicit, complete, and synthetic.
.. Commit text must be one line for the sake of history and documentation readability (replace `:` with `()` and `-` with `+`). No limit to the lengh of the line.
.. If the commit include documentation, set a first line commit text suitable for documentation. Put other information on other lines (they won't appear in documentation history)
. Commit often, at least on tuesdays and thursdays (even on unfinished current task).
. No `related changes` should appear on the change in Gerrit, or you did not handle multiple review properly.
. Fixing Jenkins failures is always a top priority.
. On `Cannot merge` Gerrit message, you have to pull/commit/push to rebase properly
. When Jenkins give a `+1`, add the `reviewers` list as reviewers, this should add all reviewing people.
. When added as a reviewer, try to give a review in the next half day, knowing that it blocks the process.
.. You don't have to be an expert to do a review. At least try to spot pieces of code not well explained and missing javadoc. Try to imagine yourself as a future bug fixer who needs clean code to work properly.
.. If suitable, test the application or check the auto IT tests.
.. If any, check that the generated documention looks good in PDF.
.. Check that there is UT specifically testing the new/modified code.
. When at least 25% of the team gave a `+1`, add the `validators` list of reviewers for a final `+2` review followed by a submit to the master branch.

=== Submit replaced with Submit including parents

If the btn:[Submit] button is replaced with btn:[Submit including parents], there is obviously a problem in the git tree. You have to rebase. You can ask the developer to do so in his IDE and push again. But you can also do it in the UI :

* Click btn:[Rebase], select
* [x] Change parent revision
* leave the field blank
* Click btn:[Rebase]
