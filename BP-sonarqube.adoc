SonarQube helps you calculate and monitor in near real time your code quality for most development languages.

== Server configuration

=== Quality Gates

Click on *Quality Gate*

Create a new one for your project and select your quality gate rules :

* Comments is less than 30 then 25
* Coverage is less than 86 then 80
* Maintainability Raiting is worse than A then C
* Reliability Raiting is worse than A then C
* Security Raiting is worse than A then C
* Unit Test Success (%) is worse than A then C

=== Update

[NOTE]
====
This has to be done only for a new Production Line
====

*Administration* -> *System* -> *Update Center*

- SonarJava : install or update to latest
- Findbugs : install
- SoftVis3D : install

=== Rules / quality profile

==== Export

* Navigate to *Quality Profiles* -> *BCT* (or your profile) -> *Actions* -> *Back Up*
* This will download a XML
* On CG-WM, the common java XML quality profile is saved here :

 src\docs\SonarQube.qualityProfile.BCT.xml

==== Import

WARNING: for an import to be successful, SonarQube must know the rules, so SonarJava and Findbugs must be up to date

* Navigate to *Quality Profiles* -> dropdown menu next to *Create* -> *Restore Profile*
* Provide the saved XML

==== Create

[NOTE]
====
This has to be done only if you want to define a custom set of rules
====

* Choose *Quality Profiles* -> *Java* -> *Sonar way* -> *Copy*
* Select the newly created profile
* Now you can :
** Click on the number of active rules to deactivate some
** Click on *Activate More*
** Go to *Rules*, search one and change its value

=== Technical Debt

* Select *Administration* -> *Configuration* -> *General Settings* -> *Technical Debt*
* Set Maintainability rating grid = 0.01,0.02,0.03,0.05

** _This means that a tech debt < 1% is rated A, a tech debt > 5% is rated E._

* Hit *save technical debt*

== Troubleshooting

=== See SonarQube for an older build

SonarQube does not have history available for browsing, you can only see the last build. So you have to retrigger the gerrit patch to see specific data associated to your change.

You can do an empty **commit amend** from Eclipse. But you can also retrigger from Jenkins.

* Go to Jenkins homepage
* Navigate to the pipeline/job
* If your build is still in the history
** Open it
** Select *Retrigger*
* Else if your build has been deleted
** Go to Jenkins homepage
** Click on *Query and Trigger Gerrit Patches*
** In *Query String*, put your change-id
** Click *SEARCH*
** Select the change 
** Click *TRIGGER SELECTED*

=== Make sure I've got all the relevant new rules in my profile

Each time a language plugin update is released, new rules are added, but they won't appear automatically in your profile unless you're using a built-in profile such as Sonar way.

If you're not using a built-in profile, you can compare your profile to the built-in profile to see what new on-by-default rules you're missing.

Another option is to go to the Rules space, and use the Available Since search facet to see what rules have been added to the platform since the day you upgraded the relevant plugin.

And finally, the profile interface itself will help you be aware of rules added in a new plugin version in the Latest New Rules section on the right of the interface.
