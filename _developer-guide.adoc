== Introduction

image:dilbert-collaboration.png[]

The purpose of this document is to guide you in the setup of the development environment for CG webMethods (CG-WM) project.

CG-WM gather is mainly composed of 3 projects :

* **cg-utils** (java 8)
** utility java methods for any webMethods project (see [02])
** includes asynchronous ano handling (see [03])
* **cg-msg-tracker** (java 8)
** Swing application for monitoring Broker / Universal Messaging publish/subscribe documents
* **cg-elastic** (java 8)
** Elastic Stack custom webMethods module for continuous monitoring

Developements on this project are heavily relying on the production line https://cric.pl.s2-eu.nvx.com/ to implement Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment / Continuous Performance Testing / Continuous Monitoring.

These projects are maintained in an Open Source mode within nvx. This can be volontary to increase personnel knowledge, overall projects quality, or this can be part of a future or actual client need.
